# 🏥 **Dental Imaging Management System**  

🚀 A powerful cross-platform system for managing dental imaging requests efficiently. The project consists of two separate applications:  

1. **📲 Dentist App** – Allows dentists to submit imaging requests.  
2. **🏥 Imaging Center App** – Manages incoming requests, applies search & filtering, and generates PDF reports.  

Both apps are developed using **Flutter** and **Supabase**, with authentication and local caching for enhanced performance.
